# Falsy's Utilities

This is a small and lightweight utility library that brings together commonly used functions during development. While there are already many major and excellent libraries available, they often include a lot of unused methods. Therefore, we are developing this library by focusing on only the essential features, keeping it lightweight.

It's still in the early stages of development, so there's much room for improvement.
